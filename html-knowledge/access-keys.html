          NEAR accounts can have multiple access keys, each with their own set of permissions. There are 2 types of access keys: (1) FullAccess keys, that give total control over the account, and (2) FunctionCall keys, which can only be used to to call specific methods on a contract.

      <div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">

          FullAccess keys have full control of an account, similar to having administrator privileges on your operating system. Particularly, Full Access keys can perform any action in your account's behalf such as: transferring funds, deploying a contract or calling other methods.

      <div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
          FunctionCall keys are like OAuths: they only give permission to call non-payable methods on contracts. You can create one and give it to third-parties so they can make some method calls in your name.

      <div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
        <div itemprop="text">
          If you remove all keys from an account, then the account will become locked, meaning that it cannot sign transactions. In practice, this means that only the account's smart contract can transfer assets, create sub-accounts, or update its own code.
