          Smart contracts are simple programs that live in the NEAR network. As any modern application, they store data and expose methods to interact with them. Contracts can be written in Javascript or Rust, and compile to WebAssembly. Once compiled, they can be deployed into a NEAR account so everyone can interact with them.
